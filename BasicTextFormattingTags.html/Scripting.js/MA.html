                    <header><b>Hero's Characterstics....</b></header>
                    <p>A hero is the central figure or protagonist in a story, movie, or narrative who embodies qualities that inspire admiration and often serves as a role model. Heroes are typically portrayed as individuals who face challenges and adversities, often rising above them to achieve greatness or bring about a positive change.
                        <br>
                        A hero's characteristics often reflect their journey and the values they represent. They are usually brave and selfless, willing to sacrifice their comfort or safety for the greater good. A hero often has a strong sense of justice, standing up against evil or injustice, even when the odds are against them. They possess a unique blend of strength and vulnerability, showing that they are not invincible but are defined by their ability to overcome their fears and flaws.
                        <br>
                        Heroes also exhibit determination and perseverance, pushing through challenges with unwavering resolve. They inspire others through their actions, becoming a source of hope and motivation. Beyond physical strength or skills, their true power lies in their compassion, empathy, and the belief that they can make a difference.
                        <br>
                        In movies, heroes often embark on transformative journeys, evolving through their experiences and struggles. Whether they are action-packed warriors, thoughtful leaders, or everyday individuals rising to the occasion, heroes are a reflection of the ideals and aspirations of the society they represent.
